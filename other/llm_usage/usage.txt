**Introduction**  

Body mass index (BMI) is a widely used measure for assessing whether an individual's weight is within a healthy range, with significant implications for health outcomes such as heart disease, diabetes, and mortality. Given its importance, understanding the factors that influence BMI, such as socioeconomic and lifestyle variables, has become an essential area of public health research. While existing studies have examined some of these relationships, questions remain about how variables like poverty, physical activity, age, sleep duration, and gender interact to influence BMI outcomes. This paper aims to address these relationships in detail.  

Using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this study focuses on modeling log-transformed BMI as a function of four primary predictors: poverty level, physical activity frequency, age, and sleep duration, along with gender as a categorical variable. A multilinear regression approach was employed to quantify these relationships, identifying patterns and trends within the dataset that could explain variations in BMI.  

The results indicate that while the correlations between BMI and these predictors are generally weak, several significant relationships exist. Higher poverty levels and more frequent physical activity are associated with lower BMI, whereas older age, longer sleep durations, and being male are associated with higher BMI. These findings reflect the complex and sometimes opposing effects of socioeconomic and lifestyle factors on BMI.  

These results are essential for informing public health initiatives aimed at addressing weight-related health challenges. By identifying specific socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that influence BMI, this research provides a foundation for developing targeted interventions and strategies to promote healthier weight maintenance, particularly in populations affected by poverty or limited access to resources.

[# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

The data used for anlysis is from the 2.1.0 version of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study published in July,2015. This is survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the early 1960’s. Since 1999 approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages are interviewed in their homes every year and complete the health examination component of the survey. The health examination is conducted in a mobile examination centre (MEC). The data were originally assembled by Michelle Dalrymple of Cashmere High School and Chris Wild of the University of Auckland, New Zealand for use in teaching statistics. The raw data includes 10000 observations and 76 variables. 

The data is cleaned by first only leaving variables relevent to the reserach topic, which are BMI, poverty, PhysActiveDays, SleepHrsNight, Gender, and Age. Then, all the missing values are cleaned leaving 3573 observations in the cleaned data. A summary table of cleaned data is shown in table 1.

The dataset was prepared, cleaned, and analyzed using R (R Core Team, 2022) with the following libraries: opendatatoronto (Gelfand, 2022) for accessing the data, tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019), dplyr (Wickham et al., 2023) for data manipulation, and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) for visualizations. Additionally, knitr (Xie, 2023a) was used for report generation, and styler (Müller et al., 2024) ensured the R code was properly styled.

## Predictor variables
The following predictor variables are used to anlysis the potential lifestyle and poverty factors which influence BMI.
poverty: A ratio of family income to poverty guidelines. Smaller numbers indicate more poverty
PhysActiveDays: Number of days in a typical week that participant does moderate or vigorousintensity activity. Reported for participants 12 years or older.
SleepHrsNight: Self-reported number of hours study participant usually gets at night on weekdays or workdays. Reported for participants aged 16 years and older.
Gender: Gender (sex) of study participant coded as male or female
Age: age in years at screening of study participant. Note: Subjects 80 years or older were recorded as 80.

Based on the summary table shown in figure 1 and histograms of predictors shown in figure 3, we can see the distribusion of these predictors in the data. Poverty index ranged from 0 to 5, with mean being 3.077. The histogram shows a trend of highly left skewed, indicating that most people are poor. PhysActiveDays range from 2 to 7, with mean being 3.7. Age range from 16 to 80, while mean is 43.61, The slightly right skewed shown in histogram shows that most participant are in the age of 29 to 56. SleepHrsNight range ram 2 hours to 12 hours, with mean being 6.956. The histogram of SleepHrsNight approximate a normal distribution. There are 1814 males and 1759 female participant, showing that the gender of participants is nearly equally distributed ] ignore the measurement part, edit my whole data section according to the rubric here, add or delete as much info as you need: A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. The broader context of the dataset should be discussed. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships between the variables. You are not doing EDA in this section--you are talking the reader through the variables that are of interest. If this becomes too detailed, then appendices could be used.

Data {#sec-data}
Overview
The dataset used in this analysis is derived from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), version 2.1.0, published in July 2015. NHANES is a long-running study conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) that has been gathering health and nutrition data since the early 1960s. Since 1999, approximately 5,000 individuals from various age groups have been interviewed annually in their homes and undergone health examinations at mobile examination centers (MEC). The dataset contains 10,000 observations and 76 variables. The data used here was originally compiled by Michelle Dalrymple (Cashmere High School) and Chris Wild (University of Auckland, New Zealand) for educational purposes.

For the current study, the data was cleaned to focus on variables pertinent to the analysis of BMI. Specifically, variables such as BMI, poverty index, physical activity days, sleep hours, gender, and age were retained. After cleaning the dataset, 3,573 observations remained. The data was analyzed using R (R Core Team, 2022) with libraries like tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) for data manipulation, ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) for visualizations, and knitr (Xie, 2023a) for report generation.

Outcome Variables
The primary outcome variable in this study is log-transformed BMI, a measure of body mass index adjusted to normalize its distribution. BMI is widely used to assess healthy weight relative to height, and its relevance to health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes has been well-established. For this analysis, BMI was log-transformed to address its skewed distribution, providing a better fit for statistical modeling.

Predictor Variables
The following predictor variables are included in the analysis of factors that may influence BMI:

Poverty Index: This is the ratio of family income to federal poverty guidelines. Lower values indicate higher poverty levels, and it is expected to have a negative correlation with BMI.

Physical Activity Days (PhysActiveDays): This variable represents the number of days per week the participant engages in moderate or vigorous physical activity. A higher number of active days is hypothesized to correlate with a lower BMI.

Sleep Hours (SleepHrsNight): This variable indicates the average number of hours the participant sleeps per night. Adequate sleep is generally linked to healthier BMI levels.

Gender: The gender of the participant, recorded as male or female. Gender is expected to influence BMI, with males typically having higher BMIs.

Age: The participant’s age in years. Older age is expected to correlate with higher BMI due to age-related metabolic changes.
