**Introduction**  

Body mass index (BMI) is a widely used measure for assessing whether an individual's weight is within a healthy range, with significant implications for health outcomes such as heart disease, diabetes, and mortality. Given its importance, understanding the factors that influence BMI, such as socioeconomic and lifestyle variables, has become an essential area of public health research. While existing studies have examined some of these relationships, questions remain about how variables like poverty, physical activity, age, sleep duration, and gender interact to influence BMI outcomes. This paper aims to address these relationships in detail.  

Using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this study focuses on modeling log-transformed BMI as a function of four primary predictors: poverty level, physical activity frequency, age, and sleep duration, along with gender as a categorical variable. A multilinear regression approach was employed to quantify these relationships, identifying patterns and trends within the dataset that could explain variations in BMI.  

The results indicate that while the correlations between BMI and these predictors are generally weak, several significant relationships exist. Higher poverty levels and more frequent physical activity are associated with lower BMI, whereas older age, longer sleep durations, and being male are associated with higher BMI. These findings reflect the complex and sometimes opposing effects of socioeconomic and lifestyle factors on BMI.  

These results are essential for informing public health initiatives aimed at addressing weight-related health challenges. By identifying specific socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that influence BMI, this research provides a foundation for developing targeted interventions and strategies to promote healthier weight maintenance, particularly in populations affected by poverty or limited access to resources.

[# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

The data used for anlysis is from the 2.1.0 version of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study published in July,2015. This is survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the early 1960’s. Since 1999 approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages are interviewed in their homes every year and complete the health examination component of the survey. The health examination is conducted in a mobile examination centre (MEC). The data were originally assembled by Michelle Dalrymple of Cashmere High School and Chris Wild of the University of Auckland, New Zealand for use in teaching statistics. The raw data includes 10000 observations and 76 variables. 

The data is cleaned by first only leaving variables relevent to the reserach topic, which are BMI, poverty, PhysActiveDays, SleepHrsNight, Gender, and Age. Then, all the missing values are cleaned leaving 3573 observations in the cleaned data. A summary table of cleaned data is shown in table 1.

The dataset was prepared, cleaned, and analyzed using R (R Core Team, 2022) with the following libraries: opendatatoronto (Gelfand, 2022) for accessing the data, tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019), dplyr (Wickham et al., 2023) for data manipulation, and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) for visualizations. Additionally, knitr (Xie, 2023a) was used for report generation, and styler (Müller et al., 2024) ensured the R code was properly styled.

## Predictor variables
The following predictor variables are used to anlysis the potential lifestyle and poverty factors which influence BMI.
poverty: A ratio of family income to poverty guidelines. Smaller numbers indicate more poverty
PhysActiveDays: Number of days in a typical week that participant does moderate or vigorousintensity activity. Reported for participants 12 years or older.
SleepHrsNight: Self-reported number of hours study participant usually gets at night on weekdays or workdays. Reported for participants aged 16 years and older.
Gender: Gender (sex) of study participant coded as male or female
Age: age in years at screening of study participant. Note: Subjects 80 years or older were recorded as 80.

Based on the summary table shown in figure 1 and histograms of predictors shown in figure 3, we can see the distribusion of these predictors in the data. Poverty index ranged from 0 to 5, with mean being 3.077. The histogram shows a trend of highly left skewed, indicating that most people are poor. PhysActiveDays range from 2 to 7, with mean being 3.7. Age range from 16 to 80, while mean is 43.61, The slightly right skewed shown in histogram shows that most participant are in the age of 29 to 56. SleepHrsNight range ram 2 hours to 12 hours, with mean being 6.956. The histogram of SleepHrsNight approximate a normal distribution.

Data {#sec-data}
Overview
The dataset used in this analysis is derived from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), version 2.1.0, published in July 2015. NHANES is a long-running study conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) that has been gathering health and nutrition data since the early 1960s. Since 1999, approximately 5,000 individuals from various age groups have been interviewed annually in their homes and undergone health examinations at mobile examination centers (MEC). The dataset contains 10,000 observations and 76 variables. The data used here was originally compiled by Michelle Dalrymple (Cashmere High School) and Chris Wild (University of Auckland, New Zealand) for educational purposes.

For the current study, the data was cleaned to focus on variables pertinent to the analysis of BMI. Specifically, variables such as BMI, poverty index, physical activity days, sleep hours, gender, and age were retained. After cleaning the dataset, 3,573 observations remained. The data was analyzed using R (R Core Team, 2022) with libraries like tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) for data manipulation, ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) for visualizations, and knitr (Xie, 2023a) for report generation.

Outcome Variables
The primary outcome variable in this study is log-transformed BMI, a measure of body mass index adjusted to normalize its distribution. BMI is widely used to assess healthy weight relative to height, and its relevance to health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes has been well-established. For this analysis, BMI was log-transformed to address its skewed distribution, providing a better fit for statistical modeling.

Predictor Variables
The following predictor variables are included in the analysis of factors that may influence BMI:

Poverty Index: This is the ratio of family income to federal poverty guidelines. Lower values indicate higher poverty levels, and it is expected to have a negative correlation with BMI.

Physical Activity Days (PhysActiveDays): This variable represents the number of days per week the participant engages in moderate or vigorous physical activity. A higher number of active days is hypothesized to correlate with a lower BMI.

Sleep Hours (SleepHrsNight): This variable indicates the average number of hours the participant sleeps per night. Adequate sleep is generally linked to healthier BMI levels.

Gender: The gender of the participant, recorded as male or female. Gender is expected to influence BMI, with males typically having higher BMIs.

Age: The participant’s age in years. Older age is expected to correlate with higher BMI due to age-related metabolic changes.

this is a good example of model justification: We use separate Bayesian regression models with the same predictors to estimate $pct\_harris$ and $pct\_trump$. This allows us to predict the percentage of voters supporting Vice President Harris and former President Trump, using the same high quality polls from @fivethirtyeight and the same predictors. We use end_date_num (number of days since President Biden ended his campaign on July 21, 2024) as the spline term because we want our Harris model to account for changes $pct\_harris$, in and our Trump model to account for changes in $pct\_trump$ over time. We use state, pollster, and pollscore as predictors to account for changes in $pct\_harris$ and $pct\_trump$ at the national or state-level, across different pollsters, and different pollscores. The Harris model is trained on Vice President Harris’ polling data and the Trump model is trained on former President Trump’s polling data from @fivethirtyeight.

We used the default priors from rstanarm in both our models because using a normal prior with $\mu=50$ and $\sigma=10$ for the intercept of each model allows us to reflect the central tendencies of $pct\_harris$ and $pct\_trump$ and the prior knowledge from the @fivethirtyeight presidential polls that show a close race between Vice President Harris at the national popular vote level and in each of the seven battleground states [@rstanarm].

Initially, we considered using a single Bayesian regression model to predict $pct\_harris$, using end_days_num (spline term), state, pollster, and pollscore as predictors. If we used this single Bayesian regression model, we would have calculated $pct\_trump$ as 100% - $pct\_harris$. Calculating the percentage of voters supporting Trump as 100% minus the percentage of voters for Harris would have been insufficient because there are third-party candidates who will receive a small percentage of the vote nationally and in each of the seven battleground states. This may have produced inaccurate or misleading results because either Harris or Trump could win the popular vote or a swing state with less than 50% of the vote [@fivethirtyeight]. We would have assumed that if Harris received less than 50% of the vote, she would have lost, even though this is not always the case. President Biden won the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in 2020 with less than 50% of the vote [@results2020]. Former President Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona in 2016 with less than 50% of the vote [@results2016]. With many presidential polls this election cycle showing a statistical tie between Harris and Trump in the popular vote and electoral college, calculating Trump’s support this way could overestimate it by a few percentage points and produce an inaccurate or misleading result [@silvergut]. please write one for my model

Here’s an example of a model justification tailored for your study on the relationship between BMI and predictors like lifestyle, poverty, age, and gender:

---

We use a multiple linear regression model to estimate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and various predictors, including poverty index, physical activity days, age, sleep hours, and gender. The model is designed to predict log-transformed BMI, as this transformation helps normalize the distribution of BMI and address skewness. This approach allows us to explore how these lifestyle and socio-economic factors influence BMI across the sample, using high-quality survey data from the NHANES dataset. We employ predictors like poverty, physical activity, age, sleep hours, and gender to account for key factors that are known to influence BMI, based on existing research.

We use linear regression because it is appropriate for modeling the relationship between a continuous outcome variable (log(BMI)) and continuous and categorical predictors (such as age, poverty, and gender). This method is straightforward to interpret, and the results are easy to convey, making it a suitable choice for analyzing how these factors relate to BMI.

We chose to log-transform the BMI variable due to its right-skewed distribution. Log-transforming BMI allows us to better meet the assumptions of linear regression by stabilizing variance and making the relationship between BMI and predictors more linear. This is particularly important for ensuring that the model’s estimates are valid and interpretable.

We included the variable 'Poverty' to account for socio-economic status, as previous research has suggested that lower-income individuals tend to have higher BMI levels. 'PhysActiveDays' was included to capture the effect of physical activity on BMI, as increased physical activity is typically associated with a lower BMI. Age was included as a predictor to account for the natural changes in BMI that occur as individuals age. Sleep hours were added because there is evidence that insufficient sleep can contribute to weight gain. Gender was included as a predictor due to well-established gender differences in BMI, with males typically having lower BMI than females.

We used the default settings in `lm()` from the `stats` package, which assumes normally distributed errors and does not apply any specific prior distributions, as this method does not require priors in the same way that Bayesian methods do. This approach provides a reliable way to assess the linear relationship between the predictors and BMI. However, we acknowledge that other methods, such as Bayesian regression or generalized linear models, could be used for more complex modeling, but this approach was selected for its simplicity and interpretability given the goals of the analysis.

Initially, we considered including interaction terms between predictors (such as between poverty and physical activity), but decided against it due to the complexity it would introduce and the relatively small sample size in certain subsets of the data. Including interaction terms would be appropriate in future analyses if a deeper exploration of how these factors interact is necessary.

By using this model, we aim to better understand the factors that influence BMI and provide insights into potential public health interventions that could target lifestyle changes and socio-economic factors to reduce BMI and related health risks.

--- 

This justification provides a clear rationale for the choice of model, transformation of the outcome variable, and inclusion of predictors. It also discusses the limitations and potential areas for future research, ensuring that the model is well-contextualized in your study.

not exactly, the thing is i tried interact some of the predictros, but then R-squred decrease, and the residue plot shows concentration in residule (but i don't know how to interpret this)

ChatGPT
Initially, we considered including interaction terms between predictors (such as between poverty and physical activity). However, when these interaction terms were added, the R-squared value decreased, indicating a reduced fit to the data. Additionally, the residual plot showed a noticeable concentration in the residuals, suggesting potential model misspecification or overfitting. As a result, we decided to exclude interaction terms to maintain a more interpretable and well-fitted model. Future analyses could revisit this approach with a larger dataset or alternative modeling strategies to better account for potential interactions.

### Weakness and Next Steps

While the model results provide valuable insights into the relationship between BMI and various predictor variables, there are some limitations that should be addressed in future analyses. One significant weakness is the relatively low R-squared value of 0.02335, indicating that the model only explains a small portion of the variance in BMI. This suggests that there are other factors, potentially unaccounted for in the model, that influence BMI. Although several predictors show statistically significant relationships with BMI, the explanatory power of the model remains limited. It is possible that additional variables, such as dietary habits, genetics, or environmental factors, could improve the model's ability to explain the variation in BMI.

Another limitation is the potential for omitted variable bias. Despite including a range of relevant predictors, there may be other important factors that have not been incorporated into the model. For instance, socioeconomic status, mental health, or access to healthcare may play significant roles in determining BMI but were not included in the current analysis. Future models could benefit from a more comprehensive selection of predictor variables to provide a more holistic understanding of BMI variation.

Additionally, the model assumes linear relationships between the predictors and BMI, which may not fully capture the complexities of the data. Interaction effects, such as between poverty and physical activity, could potentially reveal more nuanced relationships, but these were not included in the current model. The absence of interaction terms may have led to the underestimation of the impact of certain predictors, as the effect of one variable may depend on the level of another. Future analyses could explore interaction terms to assess whether these improve model fit and offer deeper insights into the factors that influence BMI.

Moving forward, there are several steps that could be taken to address these weaknesses. First, the inclusion of additional predictors could improve the model's explanatory power. Collecting more detailed data on lifestyle, diet, or mental health factors would help provide a more complete picture of the determinants of BMI. Second, using a non-linear model or exploring transformations of the predictors might better capture the relationships between BMI and the explanatory variables. Finally, addressing the possibility of interaction effects and testing different model specifications could enhance the robustness of the results. This could include experimenting with non-parametric models, such as random forests or gradient boosting machines, to better handle the complexities of the data. By expanding the scope of the analysis and refining the model, future work could yield more precise estimates and offer more actionable insights for public health interventions.

To perform a simulation based on your data with `set.seed(1009201917)`, we will simulate the dataset by introducing random noise and using the relationships inferred from the linear model. This will give you an idea of how the model might behave with simulated data that mirrors your original data structure. Below is an R script that simulates new data based on the variables you provided (`BMI`, `Poverty`, `PhysActiveDays`, `Age`, `SleepHrsNight`, `Gender`).

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1009201917)

# Simulating data for the predictors
n <- nrow(data)  # Number of observations

# Simulating values based on the provided data
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  BMI = rnorm(n, mean = mean(data$BMI), sd = sd(data$BMI)),
  Poverty = rnorm(n, mean = mean(data$Poverty), sd = sd(data$Poverty)),
  PhysActiveDays = sample(1:7, n, replace = TRUE),  # Simulating physical activity days (1-7 scale)
  Age = sample(16:80, n, replace = TRUE),  # Simulating ages (16 to 80 years)
  SleepHrsNight = sample(4:12, n, replace = TRUE),  # Simulating hours of sleep (4-12 hours)
  Gender = sample(c("male", "female"), n, replace = TRUE)  # Simulating gender
)

# Simulate the dependent variable (log(BMI)) based on the relationship
simulated_data$log_BMI <- 3.36 + 
                           (-0.01 * simulated_data$Poverty) + 
                           (-0.004 * simulated_data$PhysActiveDays) + 
                           (0.0013 * simulated_data$Age) + 
                           (-0.0103 * simulated_data$SleepHrsNight) + 
                           (0.0212 * ifelse(simulated_data$Gender == "male", 1, 0)) + 
                           rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.2099)  # Adding random error (residuals)

# Now we have the simulated data including the log(BMI) response variable
head(simulated_data)

# Optionally, you can plot or analyze the simulated data
summary(simulated_data)

```

### Explanation:
1. **Simulating Predictors**: The predictors (`BMI`, `Poverty`, `PhysActiveDays`, `Age`, `SleepHrsNight`, `Gender`) are simulated based on the mean and standard deviation of your data. `PhysActiveDays` is simulated as an integer between 1 and 7, representing the number of days in a week that a person engages in physical activity. Similarly, `Age` is simulated between 16 and 80, and `SleepHrsNight` between 4 and 12.
   
2. **Simulating log(BMI)**: We simulate `log(BMI)` based on the regression formula from your earlier linear model. The model coefficients are included in the equation, and the residual error (with standard deviation of 0.2099, as specified in your model summary) is added to simulate the noise around the fitted values.

3. **Seed for Reproducibility**: `set.seed(1009201917)` ensures that the simulation results are reproducible when you run the script.

4. **Random Error**: The `rnorm` function is used to generate random errors (residuals) with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.2099, to match the residual standard error from your model.

This script will generate a simulated dataset based on the patterns observed in the original data and linear model. You can adjust the specifics based on how you'd like the data to be simulated or if you'd like to incorporate other aspects of the model.

### Explanation of Tests:
1. **Missing Values:** Using **`pointblank`** to ensure that there are no missing values in the key columns. This verifies that all important columns in your dataset are fully populated.
   
2. **Valid Value Ranges:** The **`validate`** package ensures that all columns have values within the acceptable ranges. This includes checking ranges for `BMI`, `Poverty`, `PhysActiveDays`, `Age`, `SleepHrsNight`, and `Gender`.

3. **Duplicate Rows Check:** This test ensures that there are no duplicate rows in your dataset, which could skew your analysis or model.

4. **Outliers in `BMI` and `Age`:** Using **`testthat`**, these tests check for any values of `BMI` and `Age` outside the expected ranges, ensuring that no outliers are present.

5. **Data Type Consistency:** Ensures that each column in the dataset has the appropriate data type (numeric, factor, etc.).

6. **Gender Consistency:** This test verifies that the `Gender` column contains only valid values and is properly encoded.

7. **General Data Integrity:** This test checks for NA values and ensures that all critical columns are populated.

8. **Boxplot for `SleepHrsNight`:** This test uses a boxplot to check for any extreme outliers in the `SleepHrsNight` variable, ensuring it stays within the expected range.

### Running the Tests:
You can run this script in your R environment after setting up the simulated data. The tests will print out messages indicating whether your data passes the checks or if further cleaning is needed.
